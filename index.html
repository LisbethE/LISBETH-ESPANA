    <h2> About Me</h2>
    <h3> I'm a high school senior from NYC who enjoys cooking, garding and running.</h3>

    <p> 
     During the 2020 pandemic I took advantage of the free time and beginning a new hobby. Although not every hobby I tried was for me, through trial and error I found many passions.

        <h1 class="text-center">Gardening</h1>
  <p> The practice of gardening is not only very relaxing but has many benefits. Planting different kinds of flowers, herbs and trees can help pollinators, absorb co2 and remove other junk from the air such as sulfur dioxide, nitrogen, and small particles. 
 </p>

 <h2>Rosemary </h2>
   <p>Rosemary isn’t very hardy in my region, but when it survives the winter it will take on a tree-like appearance and become a very ornamental evergreen in addition to being a great culinary herb. It will also produce a profusion of attractive pale blue flowers that many gardeners have never seen in the garden.</p>

  <h2>Oregano </h2>
   <p>Oregano is a reliable winter survivor here in New York City and will spread nicely into a rounded mound of leaf growth to season pasta sauces and other recipes in the kitchen. During mid-summer the plant will be covered with tiny white flowers that bees and other pollinating insects can’t resist. The leaves are easily dried and stored to keep your homegrown oregano on hand.</p>

    <h2>Thyme </h2>
   <p>Thyme is a common and popular herb plant and this photo is an example of what a single plant can grow into within the space of a few years. It is a great ground cover that will offer a splash of color from the flowers that will completely cover the plants early each spring. This is a carefree herb that you can count on to over winter without fail.
